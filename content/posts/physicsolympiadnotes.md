My physics olympiad career summarizes to 4 years of solving problems, and getting Honorable Mention at 23rd Asian Physics Olympiad (a huge deal) and 53rd International Physics Olympiad (not so huge deal). 

I was tremendously influenced by Jaan Kalda on writing notes for Physics Olympiads, so it was a regular event I would write something in LaTeX after reading/solving anything. ~~I will nicely arrange them here when my schedule allows me so.~~

Instead of arranging them here I am just going to leave the web directory of the old website through google docs: [Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LbsedUoVl6T4r-2sBFL02gTQ4pzil-cx?usp=sharing)
