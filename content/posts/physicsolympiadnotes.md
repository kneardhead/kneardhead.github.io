My physics olympiad career summarizes to 4 years of solving problems, and getting Honorable Mention at 23rd Asian Physics Olympiad (a huge deal) and 53rd International Physics Olympiad (not so huge deal). 

I was tremendously influenced by Jaan Kalda on writing notes for Physics Olympiads, so it was a regular event I would write something in LaTeX after reading/solving anything. I will nicely arrange them here when my schedule allows me so.
