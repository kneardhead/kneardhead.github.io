\section{Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces}
Finitely many vectors spanning over a space makes the Vector Space Finite dimensional. 
\df{
Spanning Set:
}

	\thm{Linear Dependence Lemma:
	Suppose $v_1, \ldots, v_m$ is a linearly dependent list of vectors in the vector space $V$. Then there exists $v_k$ such that $v_k \in span(v_1, \ldots, v_n)$, and $span(v_1, \ldots,v_m) = span(v_1, \ldots, v_m, \text{ without having } v_k)$
	}

	\thm{
	Then length of any linearly independent list is less than or equal to the length of any spanning list.			
	}

	\pf{
	Let's prove it through induction. Namely, suppose linearly independent list of $m$ vectors and spanning list of $n$ vectors, assuming a contradiction $n<m$. 
	\[
	n = 4, m=5
	\] Linearly independent vectors $v_1,v,2,v_3,v_4,v_5$. Spanning vectors $w_1,w_2,w_3,w_4$. Technique is we adjoin a vector $u_1$ into $w_1, w_2,w_3,w_4$. We can can remove $w_4$ and the system will still span, $u_1, w_1, w_2, w_3$ by Lemma. $u_1, u_2, u_3, w_1$ still spans.  
	}

	\df{
	Let $V$ be a finite dimensional vector space. A basis for $V$ is a list which is both linearly independent and spanning.
	}
	An observation is in this case the length of the basis for $V$ is independent of the choice of the basis. Then length is called the dimension of $V$. Examples of dimension: 
	\begin{table}[htpb]
		\centering
		\label{tab:label}
		\begin{tabular}{c|c}
			Vector Space & Dimension \\
			$\mathbb{R}^{n}$ & n \\
			$\mathbb{C}^{n}$ & n \\ 
			$\mathbb{P}_n$ & $n+1$  \\
			$V \oplus W$ & $\dim(V)+\dim(W)$
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	Here $\mathbb{P}_n$ is the set of polynomials of degree $\le n$. 

	\thm{2.30: 
		Let $V$ have a spanning set $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$. This spanning set contains a basis for the vector space.
	}
	\pf{
	When can I not use $w_1$ for my linearly independent set? If it's stupid, if $w_1 = 0$, then don't use it. If $w_1 = 0$, delete it and go on. If not zero, choose it! So my first element of linearly independent set, 
	\[
	w_1
	\] If $w_2$ is a multiple of $w_1$, I better not use it.  $w_2 \neq a w_1$. Then we pick $w_3$ to not be a linear combination of $w_1,w_2$ and keep going. And eventually we will get the result, which is a spanning list $w_1,w_2, \ldots, w_n$. By the process they are linearly independent.	 
	}

	We can also have a reverse theorem, 
	\thm{
	Every linearly independent list extends to a basis. 
	}

	\thm{
	If $V$ is a finite dimensional vector space and $U$ is a subspace of $V$, then, $U$ is finite dimensional. }
	Kind of crazy this needs a proof so I won't go into that - Frank Jones, 2024.

	\thm{
		$V$ be a finite dimension. $U \subset V$. Then, there exists, another subspace such that $W \subset V$ such that $U \oplus W$ is $V$. 
	}
	\pf{
	Choose a basis for $ U$: $w_1, w_2, \ldots$. In the usual way, extend the list to get a basis for the vector space. We will have $w_1, \ldots, w_n, u_1, $, $w_n$ will form basis for $U$ and $u_n$ will form basis for $W$. }


	\thm{2.42 $V$ is finite dimensional. A spanning set of the right length is automatically a basis. An independent list of the correct length is also a basis.} 

	\thm{2.42 Let $V_1$, $V_2$ be subspaces of a finite dimensional vector space. Then we can form 
		$V_1 \cap V_2$, and we can form $V_1 + V_2$. These have dimensions, 
		\[
		\dim (V_1 + V_2) + \dim (V_1 \cap V_2) = \dim V_1 + \dim V_2
\] }\pf{Axler is proper}

\section{Section 1C Problem 12} 
	\pr{
	Prove that the union of two subspaces of $V$ is a subspace of $V$ if and only if one of the subspace contains the other. In that case $V_1 \cup V_2$ is simply $V$. 
	}

	Union of three subspaces is a subspace if one of the three contains the other two. 

	\section{Soul less problem given soul}	\pr{
	Derivation of formula for $\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2$		
	}
	\solu{
		Start with $\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3 $ (bro!)
		\[
		\sum_{1}^{n}  k^3 = n^3 + \sum_{1}^{n-1} k^3 
		=
		n^3 + \sum_{k=1}^{n} (k-1)^3
		= 
		n^3 + \sum_{k=1}^{n} (k^3-3k^2+3k-1)
		\] The $\sum_{k=1}^{n} k^3$ cancels both side. 

		\[
		0 = n^3 + \sum_{k=1}^{n} (-3k^2 + 3k -1)
		\] 
		Turns out
		\[
		3 \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = n^3 + \sum_{k=1}^{n} (3k-1)
		\] Using the idea of Arithmatic progression, we get, 
		\[
		= n^3 + \frac{3n^2 + n}{2} = \frac{2n^3+3n^2+n}{2}
		\] 

		Proves, \[
		\sum_{n=1}^{n} n^2 = \frac{n(2n^2+3n+1)}{6}
		\]
