	Given $w \in \mathbb{C}$, find $z \in \mathbb{C}$ such that $\sin z = w$. 
	}
	\solu{
		\[
		\sin z = w
		\] 
		If we consider suppose it does work, then $z = \log(\text{something})$. But now you need to prove that $\sin ( \log(\text{something}))$. Because you are assuming you have a solution. Also, when working with $\sqrt{1-w^2} $ just write a remark that there are two possible square roots.
