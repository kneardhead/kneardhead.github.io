The integral we are going to do today is similar but mostly different. 
In every complex analysis book you will find
\[
	\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {\sin ax \over x } \mathrm{d} x
\]
Using a dummy variable we can do a rewrite,
\[
	\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin t}{t / a} \mathrm{d} t / a
\]
So in our analysis we might just do the case that $a= 1$ because for other $a$ we might have minor trouble with $-/+$ signs. So we are deal with now is
\[
\boxed{
	\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} \mathrm{d} x
}
\] 
Choose $f(z) = \frac{\sin z}{z}$. Instead, we deal with 
\[
f(z) = \frac{e^{iz}}{z}
\] This is undefined at $0$. 
\[
| e^{iz} | = e^{\text{Re}(iz)} = e^{-y}
\] 
Now having a singularity at $z=0$ causes us to consider a sub circle path of $\epsilon$ radius inward to the circle and we get
\[
\int_C {e^{iz} \over z} \mathrm{d} z = 0
\] We need $R \to \infty$ and $\epsilon \to  0$. Let's talk about $R\to \infty$ first. 

So we are going to integrate along $\bigcap $ path and taking modulus
\[
\left| \int e^{iz}/z \mathrm{d} z \right| \le \int 
{ |e^{iz}| | \mathrm{d} z| \over |z| } 
\]
From here we get, 
\[
= \int_C 
{ e^{-y} R \mathrm{d} \theta \over R} = \int_C e^{-y} \mathrm{d} \theta
\]
Using $y = R \sin \theta$ 
\[
= \int_0 ^\pi e^{-R \sin \theta} \mathrm{d} \theta
\] The problem is this integral tries to go to infinitely zero, other than the two points $\theta = 0$ and $\theta = \pi $. Using symmetry we can go from 
\[
2 \int_0^{\pi / 2} e^{-R \sin \theta} \mathrm{d}  \theta 
\]
This is smaller than 
\[
< 2 \int e^{ - R \pi \theta / 2} \mathrm{d}  \theta
\]
