For the case of $N= 1$ 
\[
	\int_{C_{z_0}} \frac{1}{2\pi i }\frac{f'(s)}{f(s) - w } \mathrm{d} s = 1
\]
For $w$ near $w_0$. Now think about another holomorphic function $g(z)$ defined near $z_0$. Then let's calculate the integral $\frac{1}{2\pi i }\int {f'(s) g(s) \over f(s) - w } \mathrm{d} s$ using the residue theorem. 
Hence it' is the sum of residues of $\frac{f'(z) g(z)}{f(z) - w}$ inside $C_0$. This single residue occurs when $f(z) = w$. 
\[
= \frac{f'(z) g(z) }{f'(z)} = g(z)
\] 
Here $ w = f(z)$. In other words $z$ is what you get by taking $w$ and finding out $f'(w)$. 

Now apply the formula with $g(z) = z$. 
\[
	z = \frac{1}{2 \pi i }\int_{C_0} \frac{f'(s) s}{f(s) - w} \mathrm{d}  s
\] 
\[
	f^{-1}(w) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{C_0} \frac{f'(s) s}{f(s) - w} \mathrm{d} s
\]

Same picture as Monday, let a holomorphic function be $f(z)$ that tends to 0 quadratically as $|z| \to \infty$. 
\[
	\left|
{f(z) \cdot  z^2} \right| \le C \text{ for large } z
\]
We want to apply residue theorem to 
\[
\pi \cot \pi z f(z)
\] We choose this to be the function because it has poles to be the integers (i am writing what?)

Prove that $\pi \cot \pi z $ is bounded on this path independent of $N$. For the vertical lines 
\[
|\cot \pi (N  + \frac{1}{2} + i y) |= |\cot ( \pi N  + \frac{\pi}{2} + iy)| = 
| \cot (\pi /2 + i y) | = |\tan iy| 
\]
\[
= \frac{| \sinh y| }{\cosh y } < 1
\]
(discontinued a portion because I understand nothing what he did)
Result: Apply residue theorem then let $N\to \infty$. The integral of this huge path is 
\[
0 = \sum_{}^{} \text{Res} \left(\pi \cos \pi z f(z)\right)
\]

Application of this very same thing. 
\[
f(z) = \frac{1}{z^{2k}}
\] We will calculate 
\[
\sum_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^{2k}}
\]
